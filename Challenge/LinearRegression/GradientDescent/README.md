# Manual Implementation Of Gradient Descent
This is the code for the "How to Do Linear Regression the Right Way" live session by Siraj Raval on Youtube


## Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/uwwWVAgJBcM) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use [linear regression](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/node/250) to prove this relationship. 

Here are some helpful links:

### 1) Gradient descent visualization

### 2) Sum of squared distances formula (to calculate our error)
### 3) Partial derivative with respect to b and m (to perform gradient descent)

## Dependencies

* pandas 
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib

Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install any dependencies.

## Usage

Just run following command to see the results.

``` 
python manual.py
``` 
### Who do I talk to? ###
I would be happy to talk to you about this project and if you are interested then we can further enhance this project to.
